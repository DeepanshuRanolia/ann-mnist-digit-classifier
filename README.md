# ðŸ§  Neural Network from Scratch and MNIST Digit Classification

This project explores the fundamentals of deep learning through two core tasks:

1. **Neural Network from Scratch**  
   - A simple feedforward neural network implemented using only NumPy.
   - Covers the full pipeline: initialization, activation functions, forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.

2. **Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST**  
   - A deep learning model (likely using TensorFlow/Keras) trained on the MNIST dataset.
   - Classifies handwritten digits (0â€“9) with high accuracy.
   - Demonstrates a practical application of neural networks in image recognition.
